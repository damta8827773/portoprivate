## 📌 Project Overview

Welcome to the official repository of my personal portfolio - now re-engineered into
a **production-grade, full-stack platform**.

What began as a static site has been architected into a **typed monorepo**: a
**React 18 + TypeScript (Vite)** frontend talking to a **Node.js + Express + Prisma**
REST API backed by **MySQL**. All content - projects, certificates, skills, career
timeline, analytics, and the live chat room - is served dynamically from the API and
persisted in the database.

The signature **Glassmorphism Design**, **Neon Aesthetics**, and **interactive 3D/scroll
animations** are fully preserved - this is the same experience, rebuilt on a
professional, scalable foundation that **runs from the terminal**, not a live-preview
extension.

## ⚠️ Academic Integrity & Usage Policy

**Please read this section carefully before exploring the code.**

This repository is strictly categorized as **Open Source for Educational Analysis**.

> "Official source code for my personal portfolio. Published for **educational analysis and technical reference only**. To foster authentic learning and professional growth, please utilize this repository to understand the underlying logic rather than for direct duplication."

### ✅ Permitted Use:
* **Code Analysis:** Reviewing the architecture to understand monorepo structure, API design, and state management.
* **Reference:** Using specific patterns (e.g. the i18n system, theme store, or token-verified comments) to implement in your own unique projects.
* **Inspiration:** Observing how a static site is migrated into a typed full-stack application.

### ❌ Prohibited Use:
* **Direct Cloning:** Copy-pasting the entire codebase and deploying it as your own portfolio.
* **Plagiarism:** Claiming this work, design, or architecture as your own intellectual property.

> *"True mastery in engineering comes from building, breaking, and fixing code yourself-not by copying results."*

## 🛠️ Technical Specifications

This project demonstrates mastery across the full stack:

| Layer | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router, TanStack Query (server state), Zustand (UI state). |
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express + TypeScript, layered controllers/services/middleware, Pino logging, Helmet, CORS allow-list, rate limiting. |
| **Database** | MySQL 8 modeled with Prisma ORM - type-safe queries, migrations, and seeding. |
| **Validation** | Zod schemas guarding every write endpoint. |
| **Auth** | Firebase Authentication (Google) with **server-side ID-token verification** to prevent identity spoofing. |
| **Architecture** | npm-workspaces monorepo (`frontend`, `backend`, `shared/types`) with shared end-to-end types. |

## ✨ Key Features

* **⚡ Dynamic Theme Switcher:** Seamless toggle between Dark Mode (Neon) and Light Mode.
* **🌐 Internationalization (i18n):** Built-in dual-language support (Indonesian & English).
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** Optimized for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile with a custom hamburger menu.
* **🎨 Advanced UI/UX:** 3D hover/tilt effects, particle background, command palette (`Ctrl+K`), and an interactive 3D robot.
* **🔌 REST API:** All portfolio data served from a documented, versioned Express API.
* **💬 Live Chat Room:** Authenticated comments & owner replies, secured by verified Firebase tokens.
* **📊 Live Dashboard:** Real-time GitHub stats, visitor analytics, and country demographics.
* **📄 Dedicated Pages:** Beyond the one-page hero, the site routes to `/projects`, `/projects/:slug`, `/achievements`, `/blog`, `/blog/:slug`, and `/dashboard`.
* **🔎 Search & Filter:** Achievements and blog posts are filterable by category/tag with live search.
* **📝 Markdown Blog:** Posts are stored in MySQL and rendered by a dependency-free markdown renderer (`frontend/src/lib/markdown.ts`).
* **⏱️ Coding Activity:** Wakatime, Codewars, Monkeytype, and Umami statistics proxied and cached by the API.

## 🧭 Routes & API

| Page | Data source |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Home - all original sections |
| `/projects`, `/projects/:slug` | `GET /api/projects`, `GET /api/projects/:slug` |
| `/achievements` | `GET /api/certificates` |
| `/blog`, `/blog/:slug` | `GET /api/posts`, `GET /api/posts/:slug` |
| `/dashboard` | `GET /api/github`, `GET /api/insights` |
| `/about` | `GET /api/timeline`, `GET /api/history`, `GET /api/skills` |
| `/legal/privacy-policy`, `/legal/terms-of-service` | static, bilingual |

`GET /api/insights` bundles Wakatime, Codewars, Monkeytype, and Umami in one
response (each also available individually under `/api/insights/*`). Every
provider is **optional**: with no API key the endpoint returns representative
sample data and sets `configured: false`, which the UI badges as `demo`. Keys go
in `backend/.env` - see `backend/.env.example`.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Development)

> This is a real client/server application - it runs **from the terminal**, not by opening an HTML file.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** >= 20
- **Docker** (for local MySQL) - or any MySQL 8 instance

### 1. Clone & install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/damta8827773/portoprivate.git
cd portoprivate
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

### 3. Set up the database
```bash
npm run db:up        # start MySQL (Docker)
npm run db:migrate   # apply the Prisma schema
npm run db:seed      # load initial content
```

### 4. Run the apps
```bash
npm run dev          # API -> http://localhost:4000   -   Web -> http://localhost:5173
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.
